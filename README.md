## Graceful Degregation
Graceful degradation and service workers both aim to improve user experience but in different ways. Graceful degregation is an approach that "gracefully" handles the absences of some features that may not be supported by the user's browser, and in doing so allows it to still function in such an environment. On the other hand, service workers - which operate separately from the main application - improve performance and reliability by managing things like caching and network requests in the background. When together, they allow web apps to be stable and reliable in various different conditions.
